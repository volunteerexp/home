            <h1>My Experience In Austria</h1>
            <p>My name is Gabriel, a 19-year-old from Spain, and I’ve spent the past year volunteering in Wien. Initially, I was nervous about my late start and language barrier, but the support from my flatmates Jente and Umut, and the welcoming atmosphere of Oktoberfest, helped me adjust. My tasks at the Kindergruppe started with basic manual duties, and although I struggled with German, I gradually picked up the language and became more comfortable.
                The first Jour Fixe organized by Grenzenlos was a turning point, where I met many new people and formed close friendships. My on-arrival training was initially daunting but turned out to be a highlight, helping me connect with others and enjoy various activities. Winter posed challenges, but I embraced the snow and magical experiences, like visiting Kahlenberg.
                Connections outside the volunteer group, like with COALA Jua and Annie, were invaluable. I returned to Spain for Christmas but spent New Year’s in Wien, creating lasting memories. During the midterm, I traveled to Salzburg and then to Bad Ischl for skiing, which was a rewarding experience despite its difficulty.
